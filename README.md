# LEVERAGING-ALGORITHMS-FOR-DEPRESSION-DETECTION-IN-NATURAL-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING
This works presents a comprehensive exploration of depression identification 
methodologies, employing a diverse array of classification algorithms, including Logistic 
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Long 
Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). Utilizing a dataset comprising textual 
expressions, traditional machine learning models are juxtaposed against a deep learning 
paradigm, aiming to discern intricate patterns indicative of depression. Noteworthy 
outcomes emerge, with Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieving commendable 
accuracies of 95.60% and 95.69%, respectively. The study introduces an LSTM model, 
showcasing its potential in text-based depression identification, yielding an accuracy of 
73.79%. Beyond quantitative assessments, the research delves into the societal impact, 
ethical considerations, and sustainability of the proposed models. Recognizing the 
significance of mental health awareness, this study contributes valuable insights into 
algorithmic frameworks for depression detection, fostering a nuanced understanding of 
their applicability, ethical considerations, and societal implications. The findings not only 
provide a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art models but also underscore the 
need for responsible deployment and sustainable practices in leveraging machine learning 
for mental health applications. As I navigate the complexities of mental health analysis, 
this research seeks to offer a holistic perspective, emphasizing ethical considerations and 
societal implications while opening avenues for future research and advancements in the 
domain.
